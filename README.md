# Predator Alert Tool for Tumblr - README

# NB Under construction!
This project is currently under construction. It will be based on the preexisting Predator Alert Tool for Twitter (PAT-Twitter). Check the "Issues" tab for the latest feature requests, and feel free to make your own contributions!

The Predator Alert Tool for Tumblr (PAT-Tumblr) is an add-on to your Web browser that enables you to subscribe to and view warnings about other Tumblr users published by sources whose judgement you trust. It also enables you to create and optionally publish your own warnings, or "Predator Alerts," so you can share them with people who trust you.
